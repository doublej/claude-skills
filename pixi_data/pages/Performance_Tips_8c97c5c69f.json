The more objects you add the slower things will end up\n- Order can help, for example sprite / graphic / sprite / graphic is slower than sprite / sprite / graphic / graphic\n- Some older mobile devices run things a little slower. Passing in the option `useContextAlpha: false` and `antialias: false` to the Renderer or Application can help with performance\n- Culling is disabled by default as it's often better to do this at an application level or set objects to be `cullable = true`. If you are GPU-bound it will improve performance; if you are CPU-bound it will degrade performance\n\n- Use Spritesheets where possible to minimize total textures\n- Sprites can be batched with up to 16 different textures (dependent on hardware)\n- This is the fastest way to render content\n- On older devices use smaller low resolution textures\n- Add the extention `@0.5x.png` to the 50% scale-down spritesheet so PixiJS will visually-double them automatically\n- Draw order can be important\n\n- Graphics objects are fastest when they are not modified constantly (not including the transform, alpha or tint!)\n- Graphics objects are batched when under a certain size (100 points or smaller)\n- Small Graphics objects are as fast as Sprites (rectangles, triangles)\n- Using 100s of graphics complex objects can be slow, in this instance use sprites (you can create a texture)\n\n- Textures are automatically managed by a Texture Garbage Collector\n- You can also manage them yourself by using `texture.destroy()`\n- If you plan to destroy more than one at once add a random delay to their destruction to remove freezing\n- Delay texture destroy if you plan to delete a lot of textures yourself\n\n- Avoid changing it on every frame as this can be expensive (each time it draws to a canvas and then uploads to GPU)\n- Bitmap Text gives much better performance for dynamically changing text\n- Text resolution matches the renderer resolution, decrease resolution yourself by setting the `resolution` property, which can consume less memory\n\n- Masks can be expensive if too many are used: e.g., 100s of masks will really slow things down\n- Axis-aligned Rectangle masks are the fastest (as they use scissor rect)\n- Graphics masks are second fastest (as they use the stencil buffer)\n- Sprite masks are the third fastest (they use filters). They are really expensive. Do not use too many in your scene!\n\n- Release memory: `container.filters = null`\n- If you know the size of them: `container.filterArea = new Rectangle(x,y,w,h)`. This can speed things up as it means the object does not need to be measured\n- Filters are expensive, using too many will start to slow things down!\n\n- Different blend modes will cause batches to break (de-optimize)\n- ScreenSprite / NormalSprite / ScreenSprite / NormalSprite would be 4 draw calls\n- ScreenSprite / ScreenSprite / NormalSprite / NormalSprite would be 2 draw calls\n\n- If an object has no interactive children use `interactiveChildren = false`. The event system will then be able to avoid crawling through the object\n- Setting `hitArea = new Rectangle(x,y,w,h)` as above should stop the event system from crawling through the object",
