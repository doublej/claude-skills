  "content": "PixiJS is committed to delivering a reliable, high-performance rendering engine for the web. To support that mission, we’re launching a **Bug Bounty Program** to reward contributors who help make PixiJS more stable and robust.\n\n1. **Bounty Tag Assignment**\n   The PixiJS team will identify eligible issues and apply the **`bounty`** label along with a specific **dollar amount**.\n\nOnly issues labeled with the `bounty` tag and a dollar amount are eligible for this program.\n\nYou can find all current bounty-tagged issues [here](https://github.com/pixijs/pixijs/issues?q=is%3Aissue%20state%3Aopen%20label%3A%F0%9F%92%B0Bounty).\n\n2. **Submission Requirements**\n   To claim a bounty, you must:\n\n- Submit a **Pull Request (PR)** that fixes the issue.\n   - Link the issue in your PR description.\n   - Include a clear **example or test case** demonstrating that the bug is resolved.\n   - Follow our standard [contribution guidelines](https://github.com/pixijs/pixijs/blob/dev/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md).\n\n3. **Approval Process**\n\n- The PixiJS team will review your PR.\n   - If your fix is accepted and merged into the main branch, your bounty is approved.\n\n4. **Requesting Payment**\n   Once your PR is merged:\n\n- You can submit a payout request via our [Open Collective](https://opencollective.com/pixijs) page.\n   - Include a link to the merged PR and the bounty issue in your request.\n   - Payments will be processed through Open Collective.\n\n## Terms & Conditions\n\n- Only issues **pre-approved** with a `bounty` tag and dollar amount are eligible.\n- Bounties are awarded **at the PixiJS team's discretion**. We reserve the right to reject fixes that are incomplete, introduce regressions, or do not meet project standards.\n- You may submit fixes for issues without a bounty tag, but they will not be eligible for financial rewards.\n- Multiple contributors can submit PRs for the same bounty, but only the PR that gets merged is eligible for payment.\n- The bounty amount is fixed and non-negotiable.\n- Abuse, spamming, or low-quality submissions may result in exclusion from the program.\n\n## Sponsoring Bounties\n\nIf you are a developer or company working on a project and would like to sponsor a one-off bounty, please contact **Matt Karl** [@bigtimebuddy](https://github.com/bigtimebuddy) at **[hello@mattkarl.com](mailto:hello@mattkarl.com)** to arrange the details.\n\nSponsors can make one-time donations directly to our [Open Collective](https://opencollective.com/pixijs) to fund the bounty.\n\nWe kindly request that sponsors add an additional **10%** to the bounty amount to cover Open Collective's processing fees.\n\n## **Finding Bounty Issues**\n\nYou can easily find [eligible bounty issues](https://github.com/pixijs/pixijs/issues?q=is%3Aissue%20state%3Aopen%20label%3A%F0%9F%92%B0Bounty) on our GitHub repository.\n\nThis allows you to focus your contributions on tasks that have a financial reward.\n\n## Why We're Doing This\n\nWe believe in the power of open source and community collaboration. Our bug bounty program is designed to:\n\n- Encourage contributors to tackle important, impactful issues.\n- Recognize the hard work involved in debugging and fixing complex problems.\n- Acknowledge that the PixiJS core team is small and often focused on other critical tasks, your contributions help get issues resolved faster.\n- Make PixiJS even better for everyone.\n\nFeel free to ask questions on our [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/pixijs/pixijs/discussions) or join our [community Discord](https://discord.gg/QrnxmQUPGV).",
