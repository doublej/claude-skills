The created project will use a pre-configured build setup, allowing you to quickly get started with PixiJS development.\n\nMake sure your current working directory is where you want to create your project. Run the following command in your terminal:\n\nThis command will install and execute the [PixiJS Create](https://pixijs.io/create-pixi/) CLI and begin scaffolding your project. You will be prompted to configure your project by selecting various options, including selecting a template type for setting up your project. There are two main types of templates to choose from:\n\n#### Creation Templates (Recommended)\n\nCreation templates are tailored for specific platforms and include additional configurations and dependencies to streamline development for a particular use case. These templates are more opinionated and are perfect for beginners or those looking for a ready-to-go setup.\n\n#### Bundler Templates\n\nBundler templates are general templates designed to scaffold a PixiJS project with a specific bundler. They include the necessary configurations and dependencies but leave the project structure flexible, making them ideal for experienced developers who prefer more control.\n\nWe recommended using the Vite + PixiJS template for most projects when using bundler templates, as it provides a modern and fast setup for PixiJS applications with minimal configuration.\n\nAfter selecting your desired template, the scaffolding tool will create a new project directory with the chosen configuration. Navigate to the project directory and install the dependencies:\n\nYou can also add PixiJS to an existing project:\n\nOnce you've set up your project, here's a simple example to get started with PixiJS:\n\n:::warning\nIf using Vite you still need to wrap your code in an async function. There is an issue when using top level await with PixiJS when building for production.\n\nThis issue is known to affect Vite \\<=6.0.6. Future versions of Vite may resolve this issue.\n:::",
