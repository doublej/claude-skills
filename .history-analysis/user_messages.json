For background on how Skills work across Claude products, see [What are Skills?](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/agents-and-tools/agent-skills/overview).\n\nA Skill is a markdown file that teaches Claude how to do something specific: reviewing PRs using your team's standards, generating commit messages in your preferred format, or querying your company's database schema. When you ask Claude something that matches a Skill's purpose, Claude automatically applies it.\n\n## Create your first Skill\n\nThis example creates a personal Skill that teaches Claude to explain code using visual diagrams and analogies. Unlike Claude's default explanations, this Skill ensures every explanation includes an ASCII diagram and a real-world analogy.\n\n<Steps>\n  <Step title=\"Check available Skills\">\n    Before creating a Skill, see what Skills Claude already has access to:\n\n    ```\n    What Skills are available?\n    ```\n\n    Claude will list any Skills currently loaded. You may see none, or you may see Skills from plugins or your organization.\n  </Step>\n\n  <Step title=\"Create the Skill directory\">\n    Create a directory for the Skill in your personal Skills folder. Personal Skills are available across all your projects. (You can also create [project Skills](#where-skills-live) in `.claude/skills/` to share with your team.)\n\n    ```bash  theme={null}\n    mkdir -p ~/.claude/skills/explaining-code\n    ```\n  </Step>\n\n  <Step title=\"Write SKILL.md\">\n    Every Skill needs a `SKILL.md` file. The file starts with YAML metadata between `---` markers and must include a `name` and `description`, followed by Markdown instructions that Claude follows when the Skill is active.\n\n    The `description` is especially important, because Claude uses it to decide when to apply the Skill.\n\n    Create `~/.claude/skills/explaining-code/SKILL.md`:\n\n    ```yaml  theme={null}\n    ---\n    name: explaining-code\n    description: Explains code with visual diagrams and analogies. Use when explaining how code works, teaching about a codebase, or when the user asks \"how does this work?\"\n    ---\n\n    When explaining code, always include:\n\n    1. **Start with an analogy**: Compare the code to something from everyday life\n    2. **Draw a diagram**: Use ASCII art to show the flow, structure, or relationships\n    3. **Walk through the code**: Explain step-by-step what happens\n    4. **Highlight a gotcha**: What's a common mistake or misconception?\n\n    Keep explanations conversational. For complex concepts, use multiple analogies.\n    ```\n  </Step>\n\n  <Step title=\"Load and verify the Skill\">\n    Exit and restart Claude Code to load the new Skill. Then verify it appears in the list:\n\n    ```\n    What Skills are available?\n    ```\n\n    You should see `explaining-code` in the list with its description.\n  </Step>\n\n  <Step title=\"Test the Skill\">\n    Open any file in your project and ask Claude a question that matches the Skill's description:\n\n    ```\n    How does this code work?\n    ```\n\n    Claude should ask to use the `explaining-code` Skill, then include an analogy and ASCII diagram in its explanation. If the Skill doesn't trigger, try rephrasing to include more keywords from the description, like \"explain how this works.\"\n  </Step>\n</Steps>\n\nThe rest of this guide covers how Skills work, configuration options, and troubleshooting.\n\n## How Skills work\n\nSkills are **model-invoked**: Claude decides which Skills to use based on your request. You don't need to explicitly call a Skill. Claude automatically applies relevant Skills when your request matches their description.\n\nWhen you send a request, Claude follows these steps to find and use relevant Skills:\n\n<Steps>\n  <Step title=\"Discovery\">\n    At startup, Claude loads only the name and description of each available Skill. This keeps startup fast while giving Claude enough context to know when each Skill might be relevant.\n  </Step>\n\n  <Step title=\"Activation\">\n    When your request matches a Skill's description, Claude asks to use the Skill. You'll see a confirmation prompt before the full `SKILL.md` is loaded into context. Claude matches requests against descriptions using semantic similarity, so [write descriptions](#skill-not-triggering) that include keywords users would naturally say.\n  </Step>\n\n  <Step title=\"Execution\">\n    Claude follows the Skill's instructions, loading referenced files or running bundled scripts as needed.\n  </Step>\n</Steps>\n\n### Where Skills live\n\nWhere you store a Skill determines who can use it:\n\n| Location   | Path                                                        | Applies to                        |\n| :--------- | :---------------------------------------------------------- | :-------------------------------- |\n| Enterprise | See [managed settings](/en/iam#enterprise-managed-settings) | All users in your organization    |\n| Personal   | `~/.claude/skills/`                                         | You, across all projects          |\n| Project    | `.claude/skills/`                                           | Anyone working in this repository |\n| Plugin     | Bundled with [plugins](/en/plugins)                         | Anyone with the plugin installed  |\n\nIf two Skills have the same name, the higher row wins: enterprise overrides personal, personal overrides project, and project overrides plugin.\n\n### When to use Skills versus other options\n\nClaude Code offers several ways to customize behavior. The key difference: **Skills are triggered automatically by Claude** based on your request, while slash commands require you to type `/command` explicitly.\n\n| Use this                                 | When you want to...                                                        | When it runs                               |\n| :--------------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :----------------------------------------- |\n| **Skills**                               | Give Claude specialized knowledge (e.g., \"review PRs using our standards\") | Claude chooses when relevant               |\n| **[Slash commands](/en/slash-commands)** | Create reusable prompts (e.g., `/deploy staging`)                          | You type `/command` to run it              |\n| **[CLAUDE.md](/en/memory)**              | Set project-wide instructions (e.g., \"use TypeScript strict mode\")         | Loaded into every conversation             |\n| **[Subagents](/en/sub-agents)**          | Delegate tasks to a separate context with its own tools                    | Claude delegates, or you invoke explicitly |\n| **[Hooks](/en/hooks)**                   | Run scripts on events (e.g., lint on file save)                            | Fires on specific tool events              |\n| **[MCP servers](/en/mcp)**               | Connect Claude to external tools and data sources                          | Claude calls MCP tools as needed           |\n\n**Skills vs. subagents**: Skills add knowledge to the current conversation. Subagents run in a separate context with their own tools. Use Skills for guidance and standards; use subagents when you need isolation or different tool access.\n\n**Skills vs. MCP**: Skills tell Claude *how* to use tools; MCP *provides* the tools. For example, an MCP server connects Claude to your database, while a Skill teaches Claude your data model and query patterns.\n\n<Note>\n  For a deep dive into the architecture and real-world applications of Agent Skills, read [Equipping agents for the real world with Agent Skills](https://www.anthropic.com/engineering/equipping-agents-for-the-real-world-with-agent-skills).\n</Note>\n\n## Configure Skills\n\nThis section covers Skill file structure, supporting files, tool restrictions, and distribution options.\n\n### Write SKILL.md\n\nThe `SKILL.md` file is the only required file in a Skill. It has two parts: YAML metadata (the section between `---` markers) at the top, and Markdown instructions that tell Claude how to use the Skill:\n\n```yaml  theme={null}\n---\nname: your-skill-name\ndescription: Brief description of what this Skill does and when to use it\n---\n\n# Your Skill Name\n\n## Instructions\nProvide clear, step-by-step guidance for Claude.\n\n## Examples\nShow concrete examples of using this Skill.\n```\n\n#### Available metadata fields\n\nYou can use the following fields in the YAML frontmatter:\n\n| Field           | Required | Description                                                                                                                                                                      |\n| :-------------- | :------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| `name`          | Yes      | Skill name. Must use lowercase letters, numbers, and hyphens only (max 64 characters). Should match the directory name.                                                          |\n| `description`   | Yes      | What the Skill does and when to use it (max 1024 characters). Claude uses this to decide when to apply the Skill.                                                                |\n| `allowed-tools` | No       | Tools Claude can use without asking permission when this Skill is active. See [Restrict tool access](#restrict-tool-access-with-allowed-tools).                                  |\n| `model`         | No       | [Model](https://docs.claude.com/en/docs/about-claude/models/overview) to use when this Skill is active (e.g., `claude-sonnet-4-20250514`). Defaults to the conversation's model. |\n\nSee the [best practices guide](https://docs.claude.com/en/docs/agents-and-tools/agent-skills/best-practices) for complete authoring guidance including validation rules.\n\n### Update or delete a Skill\n\nTo update a Skill, edit its `SKILL.md` file directly. To remove a Skill, delete its directory. Exit and restart Claude Code for changes to take effect.\n\n### Add supporting files with progressive disclosure\n\nSkills share Claude's context window with conversation history, other Skills, and your request. To keep context focused, use **progressive disclosure**: put essential information in `SKILL.md` and detailed reference material in separate files that Claude reads only when needed.\n\nThis approach lets you bundle comprehensive documentation, examples, and scripts without consuming context upfront. Claude loads additional files only when the task requires them.\n\n<Tip>Keep `SKILL.md` under 500 lines for optimal performance. If your content exceeds this, split detailed reference material into separate files.</Tip>\n\n#### Example: multi-file Skill structure\n\nClaude discovers supporting files through links in your `SKILL.md`. The following example shows a Skill with detailed documentation in separate files and utility scripts that Claude can execute without reading:\n\n```\nmy-skill/\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 SKILL.md (required - overview and navigation)\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 reference.md (detailed API docs - loaded when needed)\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 examples.md (usage examples - loaded when needed)\n\u2514\u2500\u2500 scripts/\n    \u2514\u2500\u2500 helper.py (utility script - executed, not loaded)\n```\n\nThe `SKILL.md` file references these supporting files so Claude knows they exist:\n\n````markdown  theme={null}\n## Overview\n\n[Essential instructions here]\n\n## Additional resources\n\n- For complete API details, see [reference.md](reference.md)\n- For usage examples, see [examples.md](examples.md)\n\n## Utility scripts\n\nTo validate input files, run the helper script. It checks for required fields and returns any validation errors:\n```bash\npython scripts/helper.py input.txt\n```\n````\n\n<Tip>Keep references one level deep. Link directly from `SKILL.md` to reference files. Deeply nested references (file A links to file B which links to file C) may result in Claude partially reading files.</Tip>\n\n**Bundle utility scripts for zero-context execution.** Scripts in your Skill directory can be executed without loading their contents into context. Claude runs the script and only the output consumes tokens. This is useful for:\n\n* Complex validation logic that would be verbose to describe in prose\n* Data processing that's more reliable as tested code than generated code\n* Operations that benefit from consistency across uses\n\nIn `SKILL.md`, tell Claude to run the script rather than read it:\n\n```markdown  theme={null}\nRun the validation script to check the form:\npython scripts/validate_form.py input.pdf\n```\n\nFor complete guidance on structuring Skills, see the [best practices guide](https://docs.claude.com/en/docs/agents-and-tools/agent-skills/best-practices#progressive-disclosure-patterns).\n\n### Restrict tool access with allowed-tools\n\nUse the `allowed-tools` frontmatter field to limit which tools Claude can use when a Skill is active:\n\n```yaml  theme={null}\n---\nname: reading-files-safely\ndescription: Read files without making changes. Use when you need read-only file access.\nallowed-tools: Read, Grep, Glob\n---\n\n# Safe File Reader\n\nThis Skill provides read-only file access.\n\n## Instructions\n1. Use Read to view file contents\n2. Use Grep to search within files\n3. Use Glob to find files by pattern\n```\n\nWhen this Skill is active, Claude can only use the specified tools (Read, Grep, Glob) without needing to ask for permission. This is useful for:\n\n* Read-only Skills that shouldn't modify files\n* Skills with limited scope: for example, only data analysis, no file writing\n* Security-sensitive workflows where you want to restrict capabilities\n\nIf `allowed-tools` is omitted, the Skill doesn't restrict tools. Claude uses its standard permission model and may ask you to approve tool usage.\n\n<Note>\n  `allowed-tools` is only supported for Skills in Claude Code.\n</Note>\n\n### Use Skills with subagents\n\n[Subagents](/en/sub-agents) do not automatically inherit Skills from the main conversation. To give a custom subagent access to specific Skills, list them in the subagent's `skills` field in `.claude/agents/`:\n\n```yaml  theme={null}\n# .claude/agents/code-reviewer/AGENT.md\n---\nname: code-reviewer\ndescription: Review code for quality and best practices\nskills: pr-review, security-check\n---\n```\n\nThe listed Skills are loaded into the subagent's context when it starts. If the `skills` field is omitted, no Skills are preloaded for that subagent.\n\n<Note>\n  Built-in agents (Explore, Plan, Verify) and the Task tool do not have access to your Skills. Only custom subagents you define in `.claude/agents/` with an explicit `skills` field can use Skills.\n</Note>\n\n### Distribute Skills\n\nYou can share Skills in several ways:\n\n* **Project Skills**: Commit `.claude/skills/` to version control. Anyone who clones the repository gets the Skills.\n* **Plugins**: To share Skills across multiple repositories, create a `skills/` directory in your [plugin](/en/plugins) with Skill folders containing `SKILL.md` files. Distribute through a [plugin marketplace](/en/plugin-marketplaces).\n* **Enterprise**: Administrators can deploy Skills organization-wide through [managed settings](/en/iam#enterprise-managed-settings). See [Where Skills live](#where-skills-live) for enterprise Skill paths.\n\n## Examples\n\nThese examples show common Skill patterns, from minimal single-file Skills to multi-file Skills with supporting documentation and scripts.\n\n### Simple Skill (single file)\n\nA minimal Skill needs only a `SKILL.md` file with frontmatter and instructions. This example helps Claude generate commit messages by examining staged changes:\n\n```\ncommit-helper/\n\u2514\u2500\u2500 SKILL.md\n```\n\n```yaml  theme={null}\n---\nname: generating-commit-messages\ndescription: Generates clear commit messages from git diffs. Use when writing commit messages or reviewing staged changes.\n---\n\n# Generating Commit Messages\n\n## Instructions\n\n1. Run `git diff --staged` to see changes\n2. I'll suggest a commit message with:\n   - Summary under 50 characters\n   - Detailed description\n   - Affected components\n\n## Best practices\n\n- Use present tense\n- Explain what and why, not how\n```\n\n### Use multiple files\n\nFor complex Skills, use progressive disclosure to keep the main `SKILL.md` focused while providing detailed documentation in supporting files. This PDF processing Skill includes reference docs, utility scripts, and uses `allowed-tools` to restrict Claude to specific tools:\n\n```\npdf-processing/\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 SKILL.md              # Overview and quick start\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 FORMS.md              # Form field mappings and filling instructions\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 REFERENCE.md          # API details for pypdf and pdfplumber\n\u2514\u2500\u2500 scripts/\n    \u251c\u2500\u2500 fill_form.py      # Utility to populate form fields\n    \u2514\u2500\u2500 validate.py       # Checks PDFs for required fields\n```\n\n**`SKILL.md`**:\n\n````yaml  theme={null}\n---\nname: pdf-processing\ndescription: Extract text, fill forms, merge PDFs. Use when working with PDF files, forms, or document extraction. Requires pypdf and pdfplumber packages.\nallowed-tools: Read, Bash(python:*)\n---\n\n# PDF Processing\n\n## Quick start\n\nExtract text:\n```python\nimport pdfplumber\nwith pdfplumber.open(\"doc.pdf\") as pdf:\n    text = pdf.pages[0].extract_text()\n```\n\nFor form filling, see [FORMS.md](FORMS.md).\nFor detailed API reference, see [REFERENCE.md](REFERENCE.md).\n\n## Requirements\n\nPackages must be installed in your environment:\n```bash\npip install pypdf pdfplumber\n```\n````\n\n<Note>\n  If your Skill requires external packages, list them in the description. Packages must be installed in your environment before Claude can use them.\n</Note>\n\n## Troubleshooting\n\n### View and test Skills\n\nTo see which Skills Claude has access to, ask Claude a question like \"What Skills are available?\" Claude loads all available Skill names and descriptions into the context window when a conversation starts, so it can list the Skills it currently has access to.\n\nTo test a specific Skill, ask Claude to do a task that matches the Skill's description. For example, if your Skill has the description \"Reviews pull requests for code quality\", ask Claude to \"Review the changes in my current branch.\" Claude automatically uses the Skill when the request matches its description.\n\n### Skill not triggering\n\nThe description field is how Claude decides whether to use your Skill. Vague descriptions like \"Helps with documents\" don't give Claude enough information to match your Skill to relevant requests.\n\nA good description answers two questions:\n\n1. **What does this Skill do?** List the specific capabilities.\n2. **When should Claude use it?** Include trigger terms users would mention.\n\n```yaml  theme={null}\ndescription: Extract text and tables from PDF files, fill forms, merge documents. Use when working with PDF files or when the user mentions PDFs, forms, or document extraction.\n```\n\nThis description works because it names specific actions (extract, fill, merge) and includes keywords users would say (PDF, forms, document extraction).\n\n### Skill doesn't load\n\n**Check the file path.** Skills must be in the correct directory with the exact filename `SKILL.md` (case-sensitive):\n\n| Type       | Path                                                                    |\n| :--------- | :---------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| Personal   | `~/.claude/skills/my-skill/SKILL.md`                                    |\n| Project    | `.claude/skills/my-skill/SKILL.md`                                      |\n| Enterprise | See [Where Skills live](#where-skills-live) for platform-specific paths |\n| Plugin     | `skills/my-skill/SKILL.md` inside the plugin directory                  |\n\n**Check the YAML syntax.** Invalid YAML in the frontmatter prevents the Skill from loading. The frontmatter must start with `---` on line 1 (no blank lines before it), end with `---` before the Markdown content, and use spaces for indentation (not tabs).\n\n**Run debug mode.** Use `claude --debug` to see Skill loading errors.\n\n### Skill has errors\n\n**Check dependencies are installed.** If your Skill uses external packages, they must be installed in your environment before Claude can use them.\n\n**Check script permissions.** Scripts need execute permissions: `chmod +x scripts/*.py`\n\n**Check file paths.** Use forward slashes (Unix style) in all paths. Use `scripts/helper.py`, not `scripts\\helper.py`.\n\n### Multiple Skills conflict\n\nIf Claude uses the wrong Skill or seems confused between similar Skills, the descriptions are probably too similar. Make each description distinct by using specific trigger terms.\n\nFor example, instead of two Skills with \"data analysis\" in both descriptions, differentiate them: one for \"sales data in Excel files and CRM exports\" and another for \"log files and system metrics\". The more specific your trigger terms, the easier it is for Claude to match the right Skill to your request.\n\n### Plugin Skills not appearing\n\n**Symptom**: You installed a plugin from a marketplace, but its Skills don't appear when you ask Claude \"What Skills are available?\"\n\n**Solution**: Clear the plugin cache and reinstall:\n\n```bash  theme={null}\nrm -rf ~/.claude/plugins/cache\n```\n\nThen restart Claude Code and reinstall the plugin:\n\n```shell  theme={null}\n/plugin install plugin-name@marketplace-name\n```\n\nThis forces Claude Code to re-download and re-register the plugin's Skills.\n\n**If Skills still don't appear**, verify the plugin's directory structure is correct. Skills must be in a `skills/` directory at the plugin root:\n\n```\nmy-plugin/\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 .claude-plugin/\n\u2502   \u2514\u2500\u2500 plugin.json\n\u2514\u2500\u2500 skills/\n    \u2514\u2500\u2500 my-skill/\n        \u2514\u2500\u2500 SKILL.md\n```\n\n## Next steps\n\n<CardGroup cols={2}>\n  <Card title=\"Authoring best practices\" icon=\"lightbulb\" href=\"https://docs.claude.com/en/docs/agents-and-tools/agent-skills/best-practices\">\n    Write Skills that Claude can use effectively\n  </Card>\n\n  <Card title=\"Agent Skills overview\" icon=\"book\" href=\"https://docs.claude.com/en/docs/agents-and-tools/agent-skills/overview\">\n    Learn how Skills work across Claude products\n  </Card>\n\n  <Card title=\"Use Skills in the Agent SDK\" icon=\"cube\" href=\"https://docs.claude.com/en/docs/agent-sdk/skills\">\n    Use Skills programmatically with TypeScript and Python\n  </Card>\n\n  <Card title=\"Get started with Agent Skills\" icon=\"rocket\" href=\"https://docs.claude.com/en/docs/agents-and-tools/agent-skills/quickstart\">\n    Create your first Skill\n  </Card>\n</CardGroup>\n\n\n---\n\n> To find navigation and other pages in this documentation, fetch the llms.txt file at: https://code.claude.com/docs/llms.txt\n",

    "content": "This session is being continued from a previous conversation that ran out of context. The conversation is summarized below:\nAnalysis:\nLet me chronologically analyze the conversation:\n\n1. **Initial User Request**: The user asked to review their claude skills folder against the Agent Skills documentation they provided. The documentation was comprehensive, covering SKILL.md file requirements, directory structure, naming conventions, progressive disclosure patterns, etc.\n\n2. **My Approach**: \n   - I launched 3 Explore agents in parallel to analyze the skills folder structure, SKILL.md frontmatter patterns, and best practices compliance\n   - Found 43+ skills in `/Users/jurrejan/Documents/development/_management/claude_skills`\n\n3. **Key Findings from Exploration**:\n   - 1 skill with invalid name format: `ezviz-protocol-analyzer` (name field uses \"EZVIZ Protocol Analyzer\" instead of lowercase-hyphen)\n   - 6 skills exceeding 500-line limit: raycast-extensions (889), dev-refactor (801), reportlab-pdf (777), blender (584), pydantic-v2 (568), ghostscript (506)\n   - All skills had valid YAML frontmatter and required fields\n\n4. **User Question**: I asked the user what scope of fixes they wanted. They selected \"Must-fix + refactor oversized skills\"\n\n5. **Implementation Work**:\n   - Fixed ezviz-protocol-analyzer name\n   - Refactored raycast-extensions (889 \u2192 199 lines) - created references/components-guide.md and references/api-reference.md\n   - Refactored dev-refactor (801 \u2192 140 lines) - created references/analysis-patterns.md, references/refactoring-strategies.md, references/common-rationalizations.md\n   - Refactored reportlab-pdf (777 \u2192 121 lines) - created references/canvas-api.md, references/platypus-guide.md, references/charts-patterns.md\n   - Refactored blender (584 \u2192 133 lines) - created references/bpy-scripting.md, references/async-patterns.md, references/mcp-integration.md\n   - Refactored pydantic-v2 (568 \u2192 187 lines) - already had references, condensed main SKILL.md\n   - Started ghostscript (506 lines) - created references/ directory, was about to create reference files and condense SKILL.md\n\n6. **Most Recent Work**: I had just created the `ghostscript/references/` directory and was about to:\n   - Create reference files for ghostscript\n   - Condense the main SKILL.md\n\nThe summary was triggered right after I created the references directory for ghostscript.\n\nSummary:\n1. Primary Request and Intent:\n   The user requested a review of their Claude skills folder at `/Users/jurrejan/Documents/development/_management/claude_skills` against the official Agent Skills documentation they provided. After I presented findings, the user chose \"Must-fix + refactor oversized skills\" which meant:\n   - Fix the invalid name in ezviz-protocol-analyzer\n   - Refactor 6 skills that exceed the 500-line limit by extracting detailed content to `references/` directories using progressive disclosure pattern\n\n2. Key Technical Concepts:\n   - Agent Skills documentation requirements: SKILL.md with YAML frontmatter (name, description required)\n   - Name format: lowercase letters, numbers, hyphens only (max 64 chars)\n   - Progressive disclosure: Keep SKILL.md under 500 lines, put detailed content in `references/` directory\n   - Directory naming should match `name:` field in frontmatter\n   - Reference files linked from SKILL.md so Claude can load them when needed\n\n3. Files and Code Sections:\n   - `ezviz-protocol-analyzer/SKILL.md` (line 2)\n     - Fixed invalid name format\n     - Changed `name: EZVIZ Protocol Analyzer` to `name: ezviz-protocol-analyzer`\n   \n   - `raycast-extensions/SKILL.md` (889 \u2192 199 lines)\n     - Condensed to overview, quick start, command modes, one complete example\n     - Created `references/components-guide.md` - List, Form, Detail, Grid, Actions\n     - Created `references/api-reference.md` - Data fetching, preferences, storage, OAuth, etc.\n   \n   - `dev-refactor/SKILL.md` (801 \u2192 140 lines)\n     - Condensed to workflow steps overview, principles\n     - Created `references/analysis-patterns.md` - Detailed checks, agent prompts\n     - Created `references/refactoring-strategies.md` - Compiling, prioritization, task generation\n     - Created `references/common-rationalizations.md` - Pressure resistance, red flags\n   \n   - `reportlab-pdf/SKILL.md` (777 \u2192 121 lines)\n     - Condensed to Canvas/Platypus quick start, quick reference table\n     - Created `references/canvas-api.md` - Text, shapes, colors, images\n     - Created `references/platypus-guide.md` - Flowables, styles, tables, templates\n     - Created `references/charts-patterns.md` - Graphics, charts, invoice template\n   \n   - `blender/SKILL.md` (584 \u2192 133 lines)\n     - Condensed to MCP quick start, common bpy patterns, workflow guidelines\n     - Created `references/bpy-scripting.md` - Detailed Python patterns\n     - Created `references/async-patterns.md` - Modal operators, avoiding UI freeze\n     - Created `references/mcp-integration.md` - PolyHaven, Sketchfab, Hyper3D\n   \n   - `pydantic-v2/SKILL.md` (568 \u2192 187 lines)\n     - Already had references/ directory with validators-guide.md, serialization-guide.md, types-guide.md\n     - Condensed main SKILL.md to essential patterns only\n   \n   - `ghostscript/SKILL.md` (506 lines - in progress)\n     - Created `references/` directory\n     - Still needs reference files and condensed SKILL.md\n\n4. Errors and fixes:\n   - No significant errors encountered. One Explore agent incorrectly reported pixijs-dev had a broken reference to `/references/` folder, but verification showed the folder actually exists and is properly structured.\n\n5. Problem Solving:\n   - Identified exactly 1 skill with naming convention violation (ezviz-protocol-analyzer)\n   - Successfully applied progressive disclosure pattern to 5 of 6 oversized skills\n   - ghostscript is the final skill to refactor\n\n6. All user messages:\n   - \"Review this claude skills folder against the documentation: [full Agent Skills documentation]\"\n   - User selection via AskUserQuestion: \"Must-fix + refactor oversized skills\" (Fix name issue AND extract content from 6 skills exceeding 500 lines to references/ dirs)\n\n7. Pending Tasks:\n   - Complete ghostscript refactoring:\n     - Create reference files (command-reference.md, conversion-examples.md)\n     - Condense main SKILL.md to ~200 lines\n\n8. Current Work:\n   I was in the middle of refactoring ghostscript (the last skill on the todo list). I had just:\n   1. Read the full SKILL.md (507 lines)\n   2. Created the `ghostscript/references/` directory with `mkdir -p`\n   \n   The next step was to create reference files and write a condensed SKILL.md.\n\n9. Optional Next Step:\n   Complete ghostscript refactoring by:\n   1. Creating `references/command-reference.md` with detailed command options\n   2. Creating `references/conversion-examples.md` with format conversion recipes\n   3. Writing condensed SKILL.md (~200 lines) with overview, common commands, quick reference table\n   \n   This is directly in line with the todo list showing:\n   `[in_progress] Refactor ghostscript (506 \u2192 ~200 lines)`.\nPlease continue the conversation from where we left it off without asking the user any further questions. Continue with the last task that you were asked to work on.",

    "content": "Guide for using PyCharm MCP terminal execution with Gemini and Codex. Topic: $ARGUMENTS (default: usage)\n\n## Overview\nWhen PyCharm MCP is available, all Gemini and Codex commands should be executed via:\n```\nmcp__PyCharm__execute_terminal_command\n```\nThis provides better IDE integration, output capture, and debugging capabilities.\n\n## Basic Usage\n\n### Standard MCP Execution\n```python\nmcp__PyCharm__execute_terminal_command:\n  command: \"gemini -p 'Your prompt here'\"\n  timeout: 60000  # milliseconds (optional, default 120000)\n  executeInShell: true  # preserve environment (optional)\n  reuseExistingTerminalWindow: true  # reuse terminal (optional)\n  maxLinesCount: 2000  # output line limit (optional)\n```\n\n### Parameters Explained\n- **command**: The terminal command to execute\n- **timeout**: Max execution time in ms (default: 2 minutes)\n- **executeInShell**: Run in shell for env vars (default: false)\n- **reuseExistingTerminalWindow**: Reuse terminal window (default: false)\n- **maxLinesCount**: Max output lines to capture (default: 2000)\n\n## Benefits Over Standard Bash\n\n1. **IDE Integration**\n   - Output appears in PyCharm terminal tabs\n   - Clickable file paths in error messages\n   - Syntax highlighting in output\n\n2. **Better Output Management**\n   - Captured in IDE's terminal history\n   - Searchable within PyCharm\n   - Preserves formatting and colors\n\n3. **Process Control**\n   - IDE manages process lifecycle\n   - Automatic cleanup on IDE close\n   - Better handling of long-running processes\n\n4. **Environment Consistency**\n   - Uses IDE's configured environment\n   - Respects project interpreter settings\n   - Maintains working directory context\n\n## Command Conversion Examples\n\n### Simple Command\n```bash\n# Original Bash:\ngemini -p \"Analyze this code\"\n\n# MCP Equivalent:\nmcp__PyCharm__execute_terminal_command:\n  command: gemini -p \"Analyze this code\"\n```\n\n### Complex Command with Pipes\n```bash\n# Original Bash:\ncodex exec \"Run tests\" | tee results.log\n\n# MCP Equivalent:\nmcp__PyCharm__execute_terminal_command:\n  command: codex exec \"Run tests\" | tee results.log\n  executeInShell: true  # Required for pipes\n```\n\n### Parallel Execution\n```python\n# Terminal 1:\nmcp__PyCharm__execute_terminal_command:\n  command: gemini -p \"Task 1\"\n  reuseExistingTerminalWindow: false  # New window\n\n# Terminal 2:\nmcp__PyCharm__execute_terminal_command:\n  command: codex exec \"Task 2\"\n  reuseExistingTerminalWindow: false  # Another new window\n```\n\n## Common Use Cases\n\n### Long-Running Analysis\n```python\nmcp__PyCharm__execute_terminal_command:\n  command: gemini --all-files -p \"Deep codebase analysis\"\n  timeout: 600000  # 10 minutes for thorough analysis\n  maxLinesCount: 5000  # Capture extensive output\n```\n\n### Quick Verification\n```python\nmcp__PyCharm__execute_terminal_command:\n  command: codex exec \"pytest -x\"  # Stop on first failure\n  timeout: 30000  # 30 seconds for quick tests\n  reuseExistingTerminalWindow: true  # Use same terminal\n```\n\n### Interactive Sessions\n```python\nmcp__PyCharm__execute_terminal_command:\n  command: gemini  # Launch interactive mode\n  executeInShell: true  # Full shell environment\n```\n\n## Troubleshooting\n\n### Command Not Found\nIf MCP can't find gemini/codex:\n```python\nmcp__PyCharm__execute_terminal_command:\n  command: /usr/local/bin/gemini -p \"...\"  # Use full path\n  executeInShell: true\n```\n\n### Environment Variables Missing\n```python\nmcp__PyCharm__execute_terminal_command:\n  command: export OPENAI_API_KEY=$OPENAI_API_KEY && codex exec \"...\"\n  executeInShell: true  # Required for export\n```\n\n### Output Truncated\n```python\nmcp__PyCharm__execute_terminal_command:\n  command: gemini -p \"Large analysis\"\n  maxLinesCount: 10000  # Increase limit\n  truncateMode: \"END\"  # Keep most recent output\n```\n\n### Timeout Issues\n```python\nmcp__PyCharm__execute_terminal_command:\n  command: codex --full-auto \"Complex task\"\n  timeout: 0  # No timeout (use carefully)\n```\n\n## Best Practices\n\n1. **Always Check Availability**\n   ```python\n   # Check if MCP is available before using\n   if mcp__PyCharm__execute_terminal_command available:\n     # Use MCP\n   else:\n     # Fallback to Bash\n   ```\n\n2. **Set Appropriate Timeouts**\n   - Quick commands: 30000 (30s)\n   - Standard tasks: 60000 (1m)\n   - Complex analysis: 300000 (5m)\n   - Installation/setup: 600000 (10m)\n\n3. **Manage Output**\n   - Use maxLinesCount for expected output size\n   - Consider piping to files for very large outputs\n   - Use truncateMode wisely\n\n4. **Environment Consistency**\n   - Use executeInShell for commands needing env vars\n   - Be explicit about working directories\n   - Test in both MCP and Bash for compatibility\n\n## Migration Checklist\n\nWhen updating commands for MCP:\n- [ ] Add MCP execution option to command\n- [ ] Specify appropriate timeout\n- [ ] Set executeInShell if needed\n- [ ] Configure output capture limits\n- [ ] Provide Bash fallback\n- [ ] Test both execution methods\n- [ ] Document any MCP-specific benefits",

Think of them as \"onboarding guides\" for specific domains or tasks.\n\n### What Skills Provide\n\n1. Specialized workflows - Multi-step procedures for specific domains\n2. Tool integrations - Instructions for working with specific file formats or APIs\n3. Domain expertise - Company-specific knowledge, schemas, business logic\n4. Bundled resources - Scripts, references, and assets for complex and repetitive tasks\n\n## Core Principles\n\n### Concise is Key\n\nThe context window is a public good. **Default assumption: Claude is already very smart.** Only add context Claude doesn't already have. Challenge each piece of information: \"Does Claude really need this explanation?\"\n\nPrefer concise examples over verbose explanations.\n\n### Set Appropriate Degrees of Freedom\n\n- **High freedom**: Multiple approaches valid, context-dependent decisions\n- **Medium freedom**: Preferred pattern exists, some variation acceptable\n- **Low freedom**: Operations fragile/error-prone, consistency critical\n\n### Anatomy of a Skill\n\n```\nskill-name/\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 SKILL.md (required)\n\u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 YAML frontmatter (name, description)\n\u2502   \u2514\u2500\u2500 Markdown instructions\n\u2514\u2500\u2500 Bundled Resources (optional)\n    \u251c\u2500\u2500 scripts/     - Executable code\n    \u251c\u2500\u2500 references/  - Documentation loaded as needed\n    \u2514\u2500\u2500 assets/      - Files used in output (templates, etc.)\n```\n\n#### Scripts (`scripts/`)\n- When the same code is being rewritten repeatedly\n- Token efficient, deterministic, may be executed without loading into context\n\n#### References (`references/`)\n- Documentation loaded as needed into context\n- Keeps SKILL.md lean\n- If files are large (>10k words), include grep search patterns in SKILL.md\n\n#### Assets (`assets/`)\n- Files used in output (templates, images, fonts, boilerplate)\n- NOT loaded into context, used within output Claude produces\n\n#### What NOT to Include\n- README.md, INSTALLATION_GUIDE.md, CHANGELOG.md, etc.\n- Only include what an AI agent needs to do the job\n\n### Progressive Disclosure\n\n1. **Metadata** - Always in context (~100 words)\n2. **SKILL.md body** - When skill triggers (<5k words)\n3. **Bundled resources** - As needed by Claude\n\nKeep SKILL.md under 500 lines. Split content into separate files when approaching this limit.\n\n## Skill Creation Process\n\n1. Understand the skill with concrete examples\n2. Plan reusable skill contents (scripts, references, assets)\n3. Initialize the skill (run init_skill.py)\n4. Edit the skill (implement resources and write SKILL.md)\n5. Package the skill (run package_skill.py)\n6. Iterate based on real usage\n\n### Step 1: Understanding with Concrete Examples\n\nAsk questions like:\n- \"What functionality should the skill support?\"\n- \"Can you give examples of how this skill would be used?\"\n- \"What would a user say that should trigger this skill?\"\n\n### Step 2: Planning Reusable Contents\n\nFor each example, identify what scripts, references, and assets would be helpful:\n- Repetitive code \u2192 `scripts/`\n- Schema/API docs \u2192 `references/`\n- Templates/boilerplate \u2192 `assets/`\n\n### Step 3: Initializing the Skill\n\n```bash\nscripts/init_skill.py <skill-name> --path <output-directory>\n```\n\nCreates skill directory with SKILL.md template and example resource directories.\n\n### Step 4: Edit the Skill\n\n#### Learn Proven Design Patterns\n- **Multi-step processes**: See references/workflows.md\n- **Output formats/quality standards**: See references/output-patterns.md\n\n#### Update SKILL.md\n\n**Frontmatter:**\n- `name`: The skill name (hyphen-case)\n- `description`: Primary triggering mechanism. Include what the skill does AND when to use it.\n\n**Body:** Instructions for using the skill and its bundled resources. Use imperative/infinitive form.\n\n### Step 5: Packaging a Skill\n\n```bash\nscripts/package_skill.py <path/to/skill-folder> [output-directory]\n```\n\nValidates and packages skill into distributable .skill file.\n\n### Step 6: Iterate\n\n1. Use the skill on real tasks\n2. Notice struggles or inefficiencies\n3. Update SKILL.md or bundled resources\n4. Test again\n",

    "content": "Implement the following plan:\n\n# Plan: Sync Claude Skills to OpenAI Codex CLI\n\n## Summary\n\nExtend `install-skill.sh` to support installing skills to both Claude Code (`~/.claude/skills/`) and Codex CLI (`~/.codex/skills/`) using symlinks. The formats are nearly identical - both use `SKILL.md` with YAML frontmatter.\n\n## Key Findings\n\n| Aspect | Claude Code | Codex CLI |\n|--------|-------------|-----------|\n| Location | `~/.claude/skills/` | `~/.codex/skills/` |\n| File | `SKILL.md` | `SKILL.md` |\n| Frontmatter | name, description, license, allowed-tools, metadata | name (\u2264100), description (\u2264500 chars), metadata |\n| Extra fields | N/A | Ignored (safe to keep) |\n\n**Compatibility**: 98% of skills work as-is. Codex ignores unknown frontmatter fields.\n\n## Implementation\n\n### File to Modify\n- `install-skill.sh` - Add Codex support\n\n### New Flags\n```\n--codex     Install to Codex only (~/.codex/skills/)\n--both      Install to both Claude and Codex\n--validate  Check descriptions for Codex 500-char limit\n```\n\n### Updated Usage\n```bash\n./install-skill.sh blender              # Install to Claude (default)\n./install-skill.sh --codex blender      # Install to Codex\n./install-skill.sh --both blender       # Install to both\n./install-skill.sh --all                # All skills to Claude\n./install-skill.sh --codex --all        # All skills to Codex\n./install-skill.sh --both --all         # All skills to both\n./install-skill.sh --validate --all     # Check all descriptions\n```\n\n### Changes\n\n1. **Add variables**:\n   ```bash\n   CODEX_SKILLS_DIR=\"$HOME/.codex/skills\"\n   CODEX_MODE=false\n   BOTH_MODE=false\n   ```\n\n2. **Add flag parsing** before main case statement\n\n3. **Add `validate_description()` function** that:\n   - Extracts description from YAML frontmatter\n   - Warns if >500 chars (doesn't block install)\n\n4. **Refactor `install_skill()`** to:\n   - Accept target directory parameter\n   - Call validation for Codex targets\n   - Install to appropriate target(s) based on flags\n\n5. **Update success messages** to indicate target (Claude/Codex/both)\n\n## Verification\n\n1. Run `./install-skill.sh --validate --all` - check for warnings\n2. Run `./install-skill.sh --codex blender` - test single skill\n3. Verify: `ls -la ~/.codex/skills/blender` shows symlink\n4. Run `./install-skill.sh --both --all` - full sync\n5. Test in Codex CLI: invoke a skill like `$blender`\n\n\nIf you need specific details from before exiting plan mode (like exact code snippets, error messages, or content you generated), read the full transcript at: /Users/jurrejan/.claude/projects/-Users-jurrejan-Documents-development--management-claude-skills/f953d4ec-8fb9-4377-aa2d-78644ac46848.jsonl",

Think of them as \"onboarding guides\" for specific domains or tasks.\n\n### What Skills Provide\n\n1. Specialized workflows - Multi-step procedures for specific domains\n2. Tool integrations - Instructions for working with specific file formats or APIs\n3. Domain expertise - Company-specific knowledge, schemas, business logic\n4. Bundled resources - Scripts, references, and assets for complex and repetitive tasks\n\n## Core Principles\n\n### Concise is Key\n\nThe context window is a public good. **Default assumption: Claude is already very smart.** Only add context Claude doesn't already have. Challenge each piece of information: \"Does Claude really need this explanation?\"\n\nPrefer concise examples over verbose explanations.\n\n### Set Appropriate Degrees of Freedom\n\n- **High freedom**: Multiple approaches valid, context-dependent decisions\n- **Medium freedom**: Preferred pattern exists, some variation acceptable\n- **Low freedom**: Operations fragile/error-prone, consistency critical\n\n### Anatomy of a Skill\n\n```\nskill-name/\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 SKILL.md (required)\n\u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 YAML frontmatter (name, description)\n\u2502   \u2514\u2500\u2500 Markdown instructions\n\u2514\u2500\u2500 Bundled Resources (optional)\n    \u251c\u2500\u2500 scripts/     - Executable code\n    \u251c\u2500\u2500 references/  - Documentation loaded as needed\n    \u2514\u2500\u2500 assets/      - Files used in output (templates, etc.)\n```\n\n#### Scripts (`scripts/`)\n- When the same code is being rewritten repeatedly\n- Token efficient, deterministic, may be executed without loading into context\n\n#### References (`references/`)\n- Documentation loaded as needed into context\n- Keeps SKILL.md lean\n- If files are large (>10k words), include grep search patterns in SKILL.md\n\n#### Assets (`assets/`)\n- Files used in output (templates, images, fonts, boilerplate)\n- NOT loaded into context, used within output Claude produces\n\n#### What NOT to Include\n- README.md, INSTALLATION_GUIDE.md, CHANGELOG.md, etc.\n- Only include what an AI agent needs to do the job\n\n### Progressive Disclosure\n\n1. **Metadata** - Always in context (~100 words)\n2. **SKILL.md body** - When skill triggers (<5k words)\n3. **Bundled resources** - As needed by Claude\n\nKeep SKILL.md under 500 lines. Split content into separate files when approaching this limit.\n\n## Skill Creation Process\n\n1. Understand the skill with concrete examples\n2. Plan reusable skill contents (scripts, references, assets)\n3. Initialize the skill (run init_skill.py)\n4. Edit the skill (implement resources and write SKILL.md)\n5. Package the skill (run package_skill.py)\n6. Iterate based on real usage\n\n### Step 1: Understanding with Concrete Examples\n\nAsk questions like:\n- \"What functionality should the skill support?\"\n- \"Can you give examples of how this skill would be used?\"\n- \"What would a user say that should trigger this skill?\"\n\n### Step 2: Planning Reusable Contents\n\nFor each example, identify what scripts, references, and assets would be helpful:\n- Repetitive code \u2192 `scripts/`\n- Schema/API docs \u2192 `references/`\n- Templates/boilerplate \u2192 `assets/`\n\n### Step 3: Initializing the Skill\n\n```bash\nscripts/init_skill.py <skill-name> --path <output-directory>\n```\n\nCreates skill directory with SKILL.md template and example resource directories.\n\n### Step 4: Edit the Skill\n\n#### Learn Proven Design Patterns\n- **Multi-step processes**: See references/workflows.md\n- **Output formats/quality standards**: See references/output-patterns.md\n\n#### Update SKILL.md\n\n**Frontmatter:**\n- `name`: The skill name (hyphen-case)\n- `description`: Primary triggering mechanism. Include what the skill does AND when to use it.\n\n**Body:** Instructions for using the skill and its bundled resources. Use imperative/infinitive form.\n\n### Step 5: Packaging a Skill\n\n```bash\nscripts/package_skill.py <path/to/skill-folder> [output-directory]\n```\n\nValidates and packages skill into distributable .skill file.\n\n### Step 6: Iterate\n\n1.

Think of them as \"onboarding guides\" for specific domains or tasks.\n\n### What Skills Provide\n\n1. Specialized workflows - Multi-step procedures for specific domains\n2. Tool integrations - Instructions for working with specific file formats or APIs\n3. Domain expertise - Company-specific knowledge, schemas, business logic\n4. Bundled resources - Scripts, references, and assets for complex and repetitive tasks\n\n## Core Principles\n\n### Concise is Key\n\nThe context window is a public good. **Default assumption: Claude is already very smart.** Only add context Claude doesn't already have. Challenge each piece of information: \"Does Claude really need this explanation?\"\n\nPrefer concise examples over verbose explanations.\n\n### Set Appropriate Degrees of Freedom\n\n- **High freedom**: Multiple approaches valid, context-dependent decisions\n- **Medium freedom**: Preferred pattern exists, some variation acceptable\n- **Low freedom**: Operations fragile/error-prone, consistency critical\n\n### Anatomy of a Skill\n\n```\nskill-name/\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 SKILL.md (required)\n\u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 YAML frontmatter (name, description)\n\u2502   \u2514\u2500\u2500 Markdown instructions\n\u2514\u2500\u2500 Bundled Resources (optional)\n    \u251c\u2500\u2500 scripts/     - Executable code\n    \u251c\u2500\u2500 references/  - Documentation loaded as needed\n    \u2514\u2500\u2500 assets/      - Files used in output (templates, etc.)\n```\n\n#### Scripts (`scripts/`)\n- When the same code is being rewritten repeatedly\n- Token efficient, deterministic, may be executed without loading into context\n\n#### References (`references/`)\n- Documentation loaded as needed into context\n- Keeps SKILL.md lean\n- If files are large (>10k words), include grep search patterns in SKILL.md\n\n#### Assets (`assets/`)\n- Files used in output (templates, images, fonts, boilerplate)\n- NOT loaded into context, used within output Claude produces\n\n#### What NOT to Include\n- README.md, INSTALLATION_GUIDE.md, CHANGELOG.md, etc.\n- Only include what an AI agent needs to do the job\n\n### Progressive Disclosure\n\n1. **Metadata** - Always in context (~100 words)\n2. **SKILL.md body** - When skill triggers (<5k words)\n3. **Bundled resources** - As needed by Claude\n\nKeep SKILL.md under 500 lines. Split content into separate files when approaching this limit.\n\n## Skill Creation Process\n\n1. Understand the skill with concrete examples\n2. Plan reusable skill contents (scripts, references, assets)\n3. Initialize the skill (run init_skill.py)\n4. Edit the skill (implement resources and write SKILL.md)\n5. Package the skill (run package_skill.py)\n6. Iterate based on real usage\n\n### Step 1: Understanding with Concrete Examples\n\nAsk questions like:\n- \"What functionality should the skill support?\"\n- \"Can you give examples of how this skill would be used?\"\n- \"What would a user say that should trigger this skill?\"\n\n### Step 2: Planning Reusable Contents\n\nFor each example, identify what scripts, references, and assets would be helpful:\n- Repetitive code \u2192 `scripts/`\n- Schema/API docs \u2192 `references/`\n- Templates/boilerplate \u2192 `assets/`\n\n### Step 3: Initializing the Skill\n\n```bash\nscripts/init_skill.py <skill-name> --path <output-directory>\n```\n\nCreates skill directory with SKILL.md template and example resource directories.\n\n### Step 4: Edit the Skill\n\n#### Learn Proven Design Patterns\n- **Multi-step processes**: See references/workflows.md\n- **Output formats/quality standards**: See references/output-patterns.md\n\n#### Update SKILL.md\n\n**Frontmatter:**\n- `name`: The skill name (hyphen-case)\n- `description`: Primary triggering mechanism. Include what the skill does AND when to use it.\n\n**Body:** Instructions for using the skill and its bundled resources. Use imperative/infinitive form.\n\n### Step 5: Packaging a Skill\n\n```bash\nscripts/package_skill.py <path/to/skill-folder> [output-directory]\n```\n\nValidates and packages skill into distributable .skill file.\n\n### Step 6: Iterate\n\n1. Use the skill on real tasks\n2. Notice struggles or inefficiencies\n3. Update SKILL.md or bundled resources\n4. Test again\n",

Think of them as \"onboarding guides\" for specific domains or tasks.\n\n### What Skills Provide\n\n1. Specialized workflows - Multi-step procedures for specific domains\n2. Tool integrations - Instructions for working with specific file formats or APIs\n3. Domain expertise - Company-specific knowledge, schemas, business logic\n4. Bundled resources - Scripts, references, and assets for complex and repetitive tasks\n\n## Core Principles\n\n### Concise is Key\n\nThe context window is a public good. **Default assumption: Claude is already very smart.** Only add context Claude doesn't already have. Challenge each piece of information: \"Does Claude really need this explanation?\"\n\nPrefer concise examples over verbose explanations.\n\n### Set Appropriate Degrees of Freedom\n\n- **High freedom**: Multiple approaches valid, context-dependent decisions\n- **Medium freedom**: Preferred pattern exists, some variation acceptable\n- **Low freedom**: Operations fragile/error-prone, consistency critical\n\n### Anatomy of a Skill\n\n```\nskill-name/\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 SKILL.md (required)\n\u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 YAML frontmatter (name, description)\n\u2502   \u2514\u2500\u2500 Markdown instructions\n\u2514\u2500\u2500 Bundled Resources (optional)\n    \u251c\u2500\u2500 scripts/     - Executable code\n    \u251c\u2500\u2500 references/  - Documentation loaded as needed\n    \u2514\u2500\u2500 assets/      - Files used in output (templates, etc.)\n```\n\n#### Scripts (`scripts/`)\n- When the same code is being rewritten repeatedly\n- Token efficient, deterministic, may be executed without loading into context\n\n#### References (`references/`)\n- Documentation loaded as needed into context\n- Keeps SKILL.md lean\n- If files are large (>10k words), include grep search patterns in SKILL.md\n\n#### Assets (`assets/`)\n- Files used in output (templates, images, fonts, boilerplate)\n- NOT loaded into context, used within output Claude produces\n\n#### What NOT to Include\n- README.md, INSTALLATION_GUIDE.md, CHANGELOG.md, etc.\n- Only include what an AI agent needs to do the job\n\n### Progressive Disclosure\n\n1. **Metadata** - Always in context (~100 words)\n2. **SKILL.md body** - When skill triggers (<5k words)\n3. **Bundled resources** - As needed by Claude\n\nKeep SKILL.md under 500 lines.

Plan reusable skill contents (scripts, references, assets)\n3. Initialize the skill (run init_skill.py)\n4. Edit the skill (implement resources and write SKILL.md)\n5. Package the skill (run package_skill.py)\n6. Iterate based on real usage\n\n### Step 1: Understanding with Concrete Examples\n\nAsk questions like:\n- \"What functionality should the skill support?\"\n- \"Can you give examples of how this skill would be used?\"\n- \"What would a user say that should trigger this skill?\"\n\n### Step 2: Planning Reusable Contents\n\nFor each example, identify what scripts, references, and assets would be helpful:\n- Repetitive code \u2192 `scripts/`\n- Schema/API docs \u2192 `references/`\n- Templates/boilerplate \u2192 `assets/`\n\n### Step 3: Initializing the Skill\n\n```bash\nscripts/init_skill.py <skill-name> --path <output-directory>\n```\n\nCreates skill directory with SKILL.md template and example resource directories.\n\n### Step 4: Edit the Skill\n\n#### Learn Proven Design Patterns\n- **Multi-step processes**: See references/workflows.md\n- **Output formats/quality standards**: See references/output-patterns.md\n\n#### Update SKILL.md\n\n**Frontmatter:**\n- `name`: The skill name (hyphen-case)\n- `description`: Primary triggering mechanism. Include what the skill does AND when to use it.\n\n**Body:** Instructions for using the skill and its bundled resources. Use imperative/infinitive form.\n\n### Step 5: Packaging a Skill\n\n```bash\nscripts/package_skill.py <path/to/skill-folder> [output-directory]\n```\n\nValidates and packages skill into distributable .skill file.\n\n### Step 6: Iterate\n\n1. Use the skill on real tasks\n2. Notice struggles or inefficiencies\n3. Update SKILL.md or bundled resources\n4. Test again\n\n\nARGUMENTS: shopify-api",

Think of them as \"onboarding guides\" for specific domains or tasks.\n\n### What Skills Provide\n\n1. Specialized workflows - Multi-step procedures for specific domains\n2. Tool integrations - Instructions for working with specific file formats or APIs\n3. Domain expertise - Company-specific knowledge, schemas, business logic\n4. Bundled resources - Scripts, references, and assets for complex and repetitive tasks\n\n## Core Principles\n\n### Concise is Key\n\nThe context window is a public good. **Default assumption: Claude is already very smart.** Only add context Claude doesn't already have. Challenge each piece of information: \"Does Claude really need this explanation?\"\n\nPrefer concise examples over verbose explanations.\n\n### Set Appropriate Degrees of Freedom\n\n- **High freedom**: Multiple approaches valid, context-dependent decisions\n- **Medium freedom**: Preferred pattern exists, some variation acceptable\n- **Low freedom**: Operations fragile/error-prone, consistency critical\n\n### Anatomy of a Skill\n\n```\nskill-name/\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 SKILL.md (required)\n\u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 YAML frontmatter (name, description)\n\u2502   \u2514\u2500\u2500 Markdown instructions\n\u2514\u2500\u2500 Bundled Resources (optional)\n    \u251c\u2500\u2500 scripts/     - Executable code\n    \u251c\u2500\u2500 references/  - Documentation loaded as needed\n    \u2514\u2500\u2500 assets/      - Files used in output (templates, etc.)\n```\n\n#### Scripts (`scripts/`)\n- When the same code is being rewritten repeatedly\n- Token efficient, deterministic, may be executed without loading into context\n\n#### References (`references/`)\n- Documentation loaded as needed into context\n- Keeps SKILL.md lean\n- If files are large (>10k words), include grep search patterns in SKILL.md\n\n#### Assets (`assets/`)\n- Files used in output (templates, images, fonts, boilerplate)\n- NOT loaded into context, used within output Claude produces\n\n#### What NOT to Include\n- README.md, INSTALLATION_GUIDE.md, CHANGELOG.md, etc.\n- Only include what an AI agent needs to do the job\n\n### Progressive Disclosure\n\n1. **Metadata** - Always in context (~100 words)\n2. **SKILL.md body** - When skill triggers (<5k words)\n3. **Bundled resources** - As needed by Claude\n\nKeep SKILL.md under 500 lines. Split content into separate files when approaching this limit.\n\n## Skill Creation Process\n\n1. Understand the skill with concrete examples\n2. Plan reusable skill contents (scripts, references, assets)\n3. Initialize the skill (run init_skill.py)\n4. Edit the skill (implement resources and write SKILL.md)\n5. Package the skill (run package_skill.py)\n6. Iterate based on real usage\n\n### Step 1: Understanding with Concrete Examples\n\nAsk questions like:\n- \"What functionality should the skill support?\"\n- \"Can you give examples of how this skill would be used?\"\n- \"What would a user say that should trigger this skill?\"\n\n### Step 2: Planning Reusable Contents\n\nFor each example, identify what scripts, references, and assets would be helpful:\n- Repetitive code \u2192 `scripts/`\n- Schema/API docs \u2192 `references/`\n- Templates/boilerplate \u2192 `assets/`\n\n### Step 3: Initializing the Skill\n\n```bash\nscripts/init_skill.py <skill-name> --path <output-directory>\n```\n\nCreates skill directory with SKILL.md template and example resource directories.\n\n### Step 4: Edit the Skill\n\n#### Learn Proven Design Patterns\n- **Multi-step processes**: See references/workflows.md\n- **Output formats/quality standards**: See references/output-patterns.md\n\n#### Update SKILL.md\n\n**Frontmatter:**\n- `name`: The skill name (hyphen-case)\n- `description`: Primary triggering mechanism. Include what the skill does AND when to use it.\n\n**Body:** Instructions for using the skill and its bundled resources. Use imperative/infinitive form.\n\n### Step 5: Packaging a Skill\n\n```bash\nscripts/package_skill.py <path/to/skill-folder> [output-directory]\n```\n\nValidates and packages skill into distributable .skill file.\n\n### Step 6: Iterate\n\n1. Use the skill on real tasks\n2. Notice struggles or inefficiencies\n3. Update SKILL.md or bundled resources\n4. Test again\n\n\nARGUMENTS: Create an \"icc-color-pdf\" skill for managing ICC profiles and colors in PDF files. Covers: Ghostscript ICC color conversion (RGB\u2194CMYK, grayscale), ICC profile embedding/extraction, PDF/X and PDF/A output intent profiles, Python tools (pikepdf, Pillow/pyCMS, Little-CMS), color space analysis and preflight validation (veraPDF, inkcov), object-type color management, device link profiles, and common print workflow tasks.",

Hero (title + description + perspective visual)\n2. Install command with copy button\n3. Features showcase (grid layout)\n4. Architecture diagram (when applicable)\n5. Tech stack cards\n6. Getting started guide\n7. Footer with links\n\n**GitHub Actions Deployment:**\n- Triggers on push to main (docs/** path)\n- Builds with Bun\n- Deploys to GitHub Pages with subpath (e.g., /project-name)\n\n### Existing Skills Integration\n- **mobile-web**: Technical mobile optimization patterns\n- **usability-fundamentals**: UX validation frameworks (Nielsen's heuristics, Laws of UX)\n- **frontend-design**: Aesthetic direction and anti-patterns\n- **animation-easing**: Timing and easing decision trees\n\n## Skill Design\n\n### Name\n`github-pages-generator`\n\n### Description\n\"Generates beautiful, animated GitHub Pages documentation sites using SvelteKit. Analyzes project structure, creates responsive docs with proven design patterns (Instrument Sans typography, fadeSlideUp animations, feature showcases), and sets up automated GitHub Actions deployment. Use when creating project documentation, marketing sites, or landing pages for GitHub repositories.\"\n\n### Workflow\n\n**1. ANALYZE** - Extract project information (fully automated)\n- Read README.md for description, features, installation\n- Parse package.json for dependencies, scripts, repo URL\n- Identify project type (library, CLI tool, web app, MCP server)\n- Extract key selling points and differentiators\n- No user questions - make intelligent defaults\n\n**2. SCAFFOLD** - Create docs structure\n- Initialize SvelteKit with static adapter\n- Set up TypeScript configuration\n- Configure Vite build\n- Create directory structure (routes, lib, static)\n- Install dependencies (Bun)\n\n**3.

GitHub Pages settings (via instructions, not automated)\n\n### Embedded Design System Specification\n\nThe skill will include this exact design system (extracted from analyzed sites):\n\n**Typography:**\n```css\n/* Fonts: Instrument Sans + DM Mono (via Google Fonts) */\nfont-family: 'Instrument Sans', system-ui, -apple-system, sans-serif;\nfont-family: 'DM Mono', monospace; /* for code */\n\n/* Sizes */\nh1: 2.5rem (40px), font-weight: 600, letter-spacing: -0.03em\nh2: 2rem (32px), font-weight: 600\nh3: 1.5rem (24px), font-weight: 500\nbody: 1.1rem (17.6px), line-height: 1.6\nsmall/secondary: 0.9-0.95rem, color: #606060\n```\n\n**Colors:**\n```css\n/* Light theme only (matching analyzed sites) */\n--bg-primary: #fafafa;\n--bg-secondary: #fff;\n--bg-tertiary: #f5f5f5;\n--bg-code: #f0f0f0;\n\n--text-primary: #1a1a1a;\n--text-secondary: #404040;\n--text-tertiary: #606060;\n--text-quaternary: #808080;\n\n--border: #e0e0e0;\n--border-subtle: #d0d0d0;\n\n--accent: #1a1a1a; /* for buttons, links */\n```\n\n**Spacing:**\n```css\n--section-padding: 60px;\n--container-max-width: 1200px;\n--container-padding: 24px;\n--grid-gap: 24px;\n```\n\n**Animations:**\n```css\n@keyframes fadeSlideUp {\n  from { opacity: 0; transform: translateY(20px); }\n  to { opacity: 1; transform: translateY(0); }\n}\n\n/* Timing */\nanimation: fadeSlideUp 0.5s ease-out forwards;\nanimation-delay: 0ms, 200ms, 400ms, 600ms, 800ms, 1000ms; /* staggered */\n\n/* Accessibility */\n@media (prefers-reduced-motion: reduce) {\n  animation: none;\n  opacity: 1;\n  transform: none;\n}\n```\n\n**Layout:**\n- Responsive breakpoints: 1000px (desktop), 700px (mobile)\n- Feature grid: 3 columns \u2192 1 column on mobile\n- Section spacing: 60px vertical padding\n\n### Implementation Steps\n\n1. **Create skill directory structure**\n   - Initialize github-pages-generator/ folder\n   - Create references/, assets/, scripts/ subdirectories\n\n2. **Write SKILL.md** with workflow sections:\n   - Frontmatter (name, description, allowed-tools: [Bash, Read, Write, Glob])\n   - When to use this skill\n   - 7-step workflow (ANALYZE \u2192 VERIFY)\n   - Project analysis patterns (README parsing, package.json extraction)\n   - Content generation guidelines (fully automated)\n   - **Embedded design system** (exact specifications from analyzed sites)\n   - Animation implementation (fadeSlideUp timing)\n   - Deployment setup\n   - Post-generation skill suggestions (mobile-web, usability-fundamentals, frontend-design)\n   - Validation checklist\n\n3. **Create reference documentation**:\n   - Extract design patterns from analyzed sites\n   - Document SvelteKit setup process\n   - Define content extraction strategies\n   - Specify animation patterns\n\n4. **Build template files**:\n   - Copy base configurations from analyzed sites\n   - Parameterize project-specific values (name, base path)\n   - Create modular +page.svelte with component sections\n   - Set up GitHub Actions workflow template\n\n5. **Write helper scripts**:\n   - Bash script for quick scaffolding\n   - Python scripts for README parsing and content extraction\n\n6. **Package skill**:\n   - Validate with quick_validate.py\n   - Package with package_skill.py\n   - Test installation\n\n### Validation Strategy\n\nAfter implementing the skill:\n1. Test on a sample project (create a minimal repo)\n2. Run the skill workflow end-to-end\n3. Verify build output\n4. Check responsive design at multiple breakpoints\n5. Test GitHub Actions deployment (in test repo)\n6. Validate accessibility (reduced-motion, semantic HTML)\n7. Compare output against consult-user-mcp and beads-kanban patterns\n\n### Success Criteria\n\nThe skill should:\n- \u2705 Generate a working SvelteKit docs site in <5 minutes\n- \u2705 Produce visually consistent output matching analyzed patterns\n- \u2705 Include fadeSlideUp animations with proper timing\n- \u2705 Set up automated GitHub Pages deployment\n- \u2705 Work for any GitHub project (library, CLI, web app)\n- \u2705 Generate mobile-responsive layouts\n- \u2705 Include accessibility features (reduced-motion support)\n- \u2705 Require minimal manual intervention\n\n## Notes\n\n- Skills don't directly invoke other skills, but can reference them in workflow instructions\n- Keep SKILL.md under 500 lines; move detailed guides to references/\n- Templates use placeholder variables (e.g., `{{PROJECT_NAME}}`, `{{BASE_PATH}}`)\n- Animation timing follows animation-easing best practices (ease-out 200-500ms)\n- Design patterns follow frontend-design anti-patterns (avoid Inter font, generic layouts)\n- Accessibility is built-in (prefers-reduced-motion, semantic HTML, proper heading hierarchy)\n\n\nIf you need specific details from before exiting plan mode (like exact code snippets, error messages, or content you generated), read the full transcript at: /Users/jurrejan/.claude/projects/-Users-jurrejan-Documents-development--management-claude-skills/22f7a987-bf0f-4c07-90ca-2491d6a2de84.jsonl",
