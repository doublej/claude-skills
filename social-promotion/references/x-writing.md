# X.com (Twitter) Writing Guide

## Post Specs

- Standard post: 280 characters (extended for premium subscribers)
- Threads: chain posts with numbered context (1/N) or standalone sentences
- Up to 4 images, 1 video, or 1 GIF per post
- Alt text on images boosts accessibility and algorithm signals

## Writing Rules

### Single Posts
- Front-load the value. First 5-7 words decide if someone reads the rest.
- Write at 8th-grade reading level. Short words, short sentences.
- One thought per post. If it needs "also" or "additionally", split it.
- Use line breaks for rhythm. White space is a weapon on X.
- End with a question or open loop to drive replies.

### Threads
- Tweet 1 is the hook — it must work standalone and make the thread irresistible.
- Each tweet should deliver value on its own. Don't write filler bridging tweets.
- 3-7 tweets is the sweet spot. Beyond 10, engagement drops sharply.
- End the thread with a CTA: follow, repost, or reply.
- Pin the most valuable tweet in the thread, not the first one.

### Hook Formulas for X

```
"I [did X] in [timeframe]. Here's what I learned:"
"Stop doing [common thing]. Do [better thing] instead."
"[Number] [things] that [result] — a thread:"
"Most people [mistake]. Here's why that's wrong:"
"[Bold claim]. Let me explain."
"The difference between [A] and [B]:"
```

## Algorithm Signals (from Twitter's open-source ranking)

**Positive signals (do more):**
- Replies to your post (strongest signal)
- Quote tweets with commentary
- Bookmarks (strong hidden signal)
- Profile clicks from the post
- Dwell time (people stopping to read)
- Posts with images/video vs plain text

**Negative signals (avoid):**
- External links in main post (put in reply)
- Hashtag stuffing (0-1 hashtags max for organic)
- Engagement bait ("like if you agree")
- Rapid-fire posting without engagement
- Identical content posted multiple times

## Product Promotion on X

- Lead with the problem, not the product name.
- Show the product in action (screenshot, GIF, short video).
- "Built this because I was frustrated with..." outperforms "Announcing...".
- Drop the link in a reply, not the main post.
- Tag relevant people sparingly — only if they'd genuinely care.
- Follow up with engagement: reply to every comment in the first hour.

## Posting Cadence

- 3-5 posts/day for growth phase, 1-2/day for maintenance.
- Best engagement windows: weekday mornings (8-10am) and evenings (6-9pm) in the audience's timezone.
- Space posts 2-3 hours apart minimum.
- Threads perform best Tuesday-Thursday.
