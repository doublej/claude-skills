# Substack Writing Guide

## Post Specs

- No character limit on articles
- Subject line: aim under 50 characters (shows in inbox)
- Subtitle: serves as email preview text — complement the title, don't repeat it
- Supports Markdown, HTML, embedded images, pull quotes, buttons, CTAs
- Mobile reading is dominant — design for small screens

## Article Structure

### Subject Line
The subject line determines open rate. Everything else is secondary.

**Patterns that work:**
```
"The [thing] nobody tells you about [topic]"
"Why [common belief] is wrong"
"How I [achieved result] in [timeframe]"
"[Number] lessons from [experience]"
"What [event/trend] means for [audience]"
"[Direct statement]: [elaboration]"
```

**Avoid:** clickbait that doesn't deliver, ALL CAPS, excessive punctuation, generic subjects ("Weekly Update #12").

### Subtitle (Preview Text)
- Expands on the subject — adds context or raises stakes.
- Shows in email preview and Substack feed.
- Keep under 100 characters for full display.
- Don't repeat the title. Add a new dimension.

### Article Body

**Opening (first 2-3 paragraphs):**
- Hook with a specific story, surprising fact, or bold claim.
- State what the reader will get by reading (the promise).
- Keep paragraphs to 2-3 sentences max.

**Middle (the substance):**
- One core argument or narrative per article.
- Use subheadings every 300-400 words for scannability.
- Short paragraphs (2-3 sentences). One-sentence paragraphs for emphasis.
- Include concrete examples, data, or stories — not abstract claims.
- Pull quotes break up long sections and highlight key insights.

**Closing:**
- Deliver on the opening promise.
- End with a clear CTA: subscribe, share, comment, or try the product.
- Substack's share buttons convert best when preceded by an explicit ask.

### Paywall Placement (for paid newsletters)
- Place `<!--paywall-->` after 300-500 words of compelling free content.
- The free section should demonstrate value and create a cliffhanger.
- Give enough that free readers share it, but hold back the best insight.

## Writing Style

- Write like you're explaining to one smart friend, not broadcasting to a crowd.
- First person works. Personal experience and opinion differentiate from generic content.
- Vary sentence length. Short. Then something a bit longer that builds on the point. Then short again.
- Use specific numbers and names instead of vague references.
- Delete every sentence that doesn't earn its place.

## Product Promotion in Substack

Substack is long-form — you have space to build context. Use it.

- **Launch articles:** Tell the origin story. Problem you faced → what you tried → what you built → how it works → what's next.
- **Feature updates:** Frame as "here's a problem you have" then reveal the solution is the new feature. Teach, don't announce.
- **Case studies:** Show real usage. Screenshots, workflows, before/after. Specifics beat generalities.
- **Technical deep dives:** Explain how it works under the hood. Developer audiences respect transparency.

Don't write an ad. Write something genuinely useful that happens to involve your product.

## Substack-Specific Tactics

- **Sections:** Use Substack sections to let readers subscribe to specific content types.
- **Notes:** Substack Notes (short-form) can tease upcoming articles and drive subscribers.
- **Cross-posting:** Substack allows cross-posting to other Substacks for audience growth.
- **Recommendations:** Recommend other newsletters — they often reciprocate.
- **Welcome email:** Customize it with your best post to hook new subscribers.

## Posting Cadence

- Weekly or biweekly with a consistent day/time builds reader habit.
- Tuesday-Thursday mornings tend to get highest open rates.
- Consistency matters more than frequency. Missing a week is worse than posting less often.
- Announce your schedule to readers so they expect it.
