# Threads Writing Guide

## Post Specs

- Standard post: 500 characters
- Text attachments: up to 10,000 characters with formatting (bold, italic, underline, strikethrough)
- Up to 10 images/videos per post (carousel format)
- Optimal image ratio: 9:16 vertical (1080x1920px)
- No hashtag pages — hashtags have limited discoverability value

## Writing Rules

### Tone
Threads skews conversational and personal. Think "talking to a friend at dinner" not "posting from a brand account." Drop the corporate voice entirely.

- Write like you talk. Contractions, fragments, casual phrasing.
- Personal opinions and hot takes perform well.
- Vulnerability and honesty outperform polish.
- Questions that invite genuine conversation > rhetorical questions.

### Structure
- Short is strong: 1-3 sentences for maximum reach.
- If longer, use the 10K text attachment for depth — but the preview (first 500 chars) must hook on its own.
- Carousels work for tutorials, step-by-step, before/after, lists.
- Single-image posts outperform text-only for engagement.

### Hooks for Threads

```
"Unpopular opinion: [take]"
"Nobody talks about this but [insight]"
"What's your [preference]? I'll go first: [answer]"
"Hot take: [provocative but defensible statement]"
"The thing about [topic] that [audience] gets wrong:"
"I changed my mind about [thing]. Here's why:"
```

## Algorithm Signals

**What Threads rewards:**
- Replies (strongest signal — meaningful conversation)
- Shares to Instagram Stories
- Time spent viewing the post (dwell time)
- Early engagement velocity (first 30 minutes matter most)
- Original content over reposts

**What suppresses reach:**
- External links in the main post body (put in reply or bio)
- Engagement bait ("like for X, reply for Y")
- Posting without replying to your own comments
- Cross-posting identical content from X (the algorithm can detect this)
- Political content (Meta actively deprioritizes it)

## Product Promotion on Threads

- Tell the story behind the product, not the feature list.
- "I built this because..." resonates more than "Check out..."
- Carousel posts work well for showing UI/product walkthrough.
- Ask for feedback: "What would you want this to do?" drives genuine replies.
- The Threads audience is Instagram-native — visual quality matters more than on X.
- Be a person first, a product second. Build trust through non-promotional posts.

## Engagement Strategy

- Reply to every comment within the first hour.
- Leave 10-15 meaningful replies on other people's posts daily.
- Engage before and after posting (warm up the algorithm).
- Comment on trending topics with your genuine perspective.

## Posting Cadence

- 1-3 posts/day for growth, consistency matters more than volume.
- Peak times: weekday evenings and weekends (leisure browsing platform).
- The audience skews 18-34, lifestyle/creative interests.
