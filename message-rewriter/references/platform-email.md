# Email Message Rules

## Subject Line
- Specific and scannable. The reader should know the topic without opening.
- Include action type when relevant: "Review needed:", "FYI:", "Decision by Friday:"
- Never generic ("Quick question", "Following up", "Hello").
- Keep under 8 words when possible.

## Structure
- **Opening:** One sentence that states what this email is about and what you need.
- **Body:** Supporting context. Short paragraphs (1-3 sentences). One idea per paragraph.
- **Close:** Clear next step or call to action. Who does what by when.
- **Sign-off:** Match the formality. "Cheers," for colleagues, "Best," for professional, "Thanks," when requesting something.

## Formatting
- Short paragraphs. Never a wall of text.
- Bullet points for lists of items, options, or action items.
- Bold sparingly — only for deadlines or critical info.
- No colored text, fancy fonts, or excessive formatting.

## Tone Spectrum
- **Internal/team:** Direct, efficient. Skip pleasantries if the relationship allows.
- **Client/external:** Professional warmth. Brief greeting, clear structure, courteous close.
- **Executive/upward:** Bottom-line first. Context after. Respect their time.

## Anti-Patterns
- Never open with "I hope this email finds you well" — say something real or skip the greeting.
- Never "Please do not hesitate to reach out" — just say "Let me know if you have questions."
- Never "As per my last email" — just restate the point.
- Never "Just wanted to check in" without a specific reason.
- Never "At your earliest convenience" — give an actual deadline or say "when you can."

## Length
- Aim for screen-readable without scrolling on mobile.
- If the email needs more than 3 short paragraphs, consider whether it should be a doc/meeting instead.
- Response emails should be shorter than the original.

## Common Patterns

Subject: Review needed: Q4 budget proposal — by Thursday

Hi Sarah,

Attached is the Q4 budget proposal. Main changes from Q3: increased infra spend (section 3) and a new contractor line item (section 5).

Can you review and flag any concerns by Thursday? Happy to walk through anything in person.

Cheers,
```

**FYI/update:**
```
Subject: Auth migration complete — no action needed

Team,

The auth migration finished this morning. All users are now on the new SSO flow. No downtime recorded.

One thing to note: password reset links from before today are invalid. If anyone reports issues, point them to the new reset page.

Best,
```
