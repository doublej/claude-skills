# WhatsApp Message Rules

## Structure
- Short bursts. Think speech, not writing.
- Split long messages into 2-3 separate messages rather than one block.
- First message: the main point. Follow-ups: context or details.
- No formal structure — no headers, no bullet lists, no sign-offs.

## Formatting
- *italic* and **bold** sparingly — most WhatsApp messages use none.
- Emoji are natural here — use them as you'd use in speech (reaction, punctuation, mood).
- No code blocks. If sharing technical info, keep it conversational.
- Line breaks between thoughts, but keep each chunk to 1-3 lines.

## Tone
- Conversational. Write like you're talking.
- Contractions always. "I'll" not "I will". "Can't" not "cannot".
- Sentence fragments are fine. "Running late. 10 min."
- Exclamation marks ok when genuine, not for fake enthusiasm.
- No greetings unless it's been a while. Jump straight in.

## Length
- Individual messages: 1-4 lines max.
- Total exchange per topic: keep it brief. If it needs more, suggest a call.
- Voice-note-length rule: if you'd send a voice note instead, the message is too complex for text.

## Common Patterns

**Quick update:**
```
Hey just shipped the fix

Should be live in about 10 min
```

**Request:**
```
Can you send me the slides from yesterday?

Need them for the client call at 3
```

**Coordinating:**
```
Running about 10 min late

Go ahead and order, I'll have whatever you're having
```
