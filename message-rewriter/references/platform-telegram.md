# Telegram Message Rules

## Structure
- Can be longer than WhatsApp — readers expect more substance here.
- One message per topic. Don't split unnecessarily like WhatsApp.
- Lead with the point, then expand if needed.
- Paragraphs are fine — keep them short (2-3 sentences).

## Formatting
- **Bold** for emphasis and key terms.
- `code` for technical references, commands, file names.
- Bullet lists for multiple items — Telegram renders them well.
- Links inline — Telegram shows rich previews, so one link per message.
- Spoiler tags (||text||) when appropriate.

## Tone
- Medium-casual. More composed than WhatsApp, less formal than email.
- Tech-literate audience assumed — no over-explaining.
- Contractions natural. Sentence fragments ok but less than WhatsApp.
- Emoji: moderate use. More than email, less than WhatsApp.

## Length
- Short messages (1-5 lines) for updates and quick exchanges.
- Medium messages (paragraph + details) for explanations or announcements.
- If it needs more than 2 paragraphs, consider a Telegram article or linked doc.

## Group vs Direct
- **Groups:** Be concise, assume others are scanning. Tag people with @ when directing.
- **Direct:** Can be more conversational, less structured.

## Common Patterns

**Technical update:**
```
Pushed the new auth flow to staging. Main changes:
- JWT tokens now expire after 24h (was 7d)
- Refresh token rotation enabled
- Added rate limiting on /login

Give it a spin when you get a chance — staging.example.com

**Sharing something:**
```
